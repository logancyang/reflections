What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	It creates a .git directory. It becomes a git repository that can 
	track version history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	It's a buffer zone between the working directory and the repository. You can 
	add some, not all the changed files to the staging area and commit to the repo
	so that other files in the repo are not affected.
